# graphviz-fiddle
A reskin of http://stamm-wilbrandt.de/GraphvizFiddle/ with more features to follow.

Graphviz Fiddle is a web version of the [IBM Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) software.  You can quickly create neat graphs quickly using the expressive [dot language](http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php).

Future effort for this repo is to add UI features, local storage support, and adding graph macros to allow you to increase the expressiveness and reduce boilerplate.
